# Package Storage

![logo](../../assets/storage-bg.jpg)

This package provides a simple way to store and retrieve data from different storage systems
including in-memory storage, file storage, and database storage and more.

You should not use this package directly, instead, you should use different package
that implements the storage interface.

However, this package provides an `in-memory` storage implementation that you can use for testing
and development purposes.
